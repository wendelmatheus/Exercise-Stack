# Exercise-Stack

Exercise: Checking Expressions with Parentheses

Write a program in a programming language of your choice to check whether a mathematical expression containing parentheses is balanced. The expression is considered balanced if each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order.

Examples of balanced expressions:

(a+b)×c
{[a+b]×c}

Examples of unbalanced expressions:

(a+b×c
{[a+b×c}

If possible, use a stack to implement the solution. The program should print "Balanced Expression" or "Unbalanced Expression" depending on the evaluation of the expression.

Tip: When going through the expression, stack the opening parentheses and, when you find a closing parenthesis, check whether the top of the stack contains the corresponding parenthesis. If so, unstack; if not, the expression is not balanced.

This exercise will test your understanding of the practical use of stacks, as well as your string manipulation and flow control skills in a specific programming language.
